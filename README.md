# SLAYseq
This is GUI and pipeline to analyze <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5786472/">SLAY sequencing</a> data.

## Dependencies
Dependencies include:

- R (with various packages)
- RStudio
- Kallisto
- Flexbar

## Instructions
Run app.R and use the GUI prompts to select fastq files, set contrasts, specify and/or create a reference sequence set (i.e. "transcriptome"), and start the pipeline. Then sit back and relax while Flexbar and Kallisto do the heavy lifting (and take ~ an hour to run).
